      %h3 How do I set a Hound reminder?
      %p ...

      %h3 What if I go to Australia for a trip and I email Hound from there.  What happens then?  If my profile is set up for Cape Town but Iâ€™m in Brisbane?
      %p Well any emails you schedule will be set/sent according the (SA) timezone.

      %p All the relative time formats (1minute@hound.cc) will still work. i.e. You send an email to 1min@hound.cc at 9pm in Oz, Hound sets the reminder for 12:01pm SAST (-9hrs).

      %p However absolute times wont make sense until you update your timezone settings. e.g. Friday10am@hound.cc would set a reminder for 10am SAST, and you'd receive the reminder at 7pm AEST.


      %h3 Do Hound reminders work with Gmail's Conversation View?
      %p Yes, just like with Mail.app's "Organize By Thread" feature, all related emails/reminders from Hound will appear in the same conversation thread as the original email(s).
