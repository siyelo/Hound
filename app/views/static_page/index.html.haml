  %p
    A client has asked your team to have a deliverable completed by the end of next week.
  %p
    %strong The problem:
    You’re team is too busy to start work on the deliverable right now as they have other deadlines.
    Tell them now and risk it being forgotten or having them crack under the stress
  %p
    %strong The solution:
    Forward the client’s email to the team, adding in that they should only start work
    on it when they receive the reminder, and cc in ‘nextwednesday@hound.cc’.
  %p
    %strong The result:
    The team can focus on their current tasks without having to worry about the client deliverable just yet.
    They will be reminded about it in due course and will have enough time to get it delivered.
